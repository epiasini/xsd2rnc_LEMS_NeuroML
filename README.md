xsd2rnc_LEMS_NeuroML
====================

Simple tool to convert the LEMS and NeuroMLv2 schemas from xsd to rng
and rnc formats.

**Requirements
`xsltproc` and `trang`.

**Disclaimer
This is provided on a best-effort basis, mainly for people using Emacs and
nxml-mode to edit LEMS and NeuroML files. It's ugly, and it may eat your dog.
